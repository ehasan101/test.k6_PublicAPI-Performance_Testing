## Performance Testing on test.k6.io with JMeter


This project is on Performance testing with JMeter for the test.k6.io on contacts, news, flip_Game,Calculating Ï€. It's a evaluating way to simulate and analyze the performance of a public API `test.k6.io` under various user load scenarios and monitoring working functionality and usability as expected.



## How to run this project!
1. Download & Install [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
2. Download & Extract [JMeter Binaries Zip](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)
3. Set environment variable(path) -  **Set JAVA_HOME**
4. Go to bin folder and open `jmeter.bat`
5. Download & Extract [project_files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13SuvIsQtVSnPtEatu--I1_O4ma-ujcb4?usp=drive_link) and Move it to `\apache-jmeter-5.5\bin folder`
6. Open the `test.k6-Performance_Testing.jmx` file on jemeter
7. **Run the project**

But in GUI mode it consumes more memory and **makes system slower**. \
So we run JMeter from the command line. There also generate an HTML report file.

8. Go to `\apache-jmeter-5.5\bin` and make a folder called "report". 
9. Now run following commands:
```ruby
jmeter -n -t project_files\test.k6-Performance_Testing.jmx -l report\test.k6-Performance_Testing.jtl  -e -o report\TestResult.html
```

**_command structure:_**
>	`jmeter -n -t [jmx file] -l [results file .jtl/.csv] -e -o [Path for html report folder]`

11. Then a HTML report will be generated in this folder.
